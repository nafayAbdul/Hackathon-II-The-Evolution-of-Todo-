# In-Memory Console-Based Todo Application Constitution

## Core Principles

### Spec-Driven Development
All implementation must follow approved specs

### Simplicity First
Console-first, minimal dependencies, readable code

### Deterministic Behavior
No hidden state, predictable outputs

### In-Memory by Design
No persistence in Phase I

### Extensibility
Code structured to support future phases without rewrite

### Testability
Logic separated from I/O for easy testing

## AI-Assisted Development
Claude Code used strictly within spec boundaries

## Quality & Style Guidelines
Meaningful variable names, small functions, PEP 8 formatting, comments where needed

## Governance
All implementation follows specs and tasks; No speculative features beyond current phase
